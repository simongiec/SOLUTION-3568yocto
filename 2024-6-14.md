# Meeting Topic:
Discussing and understanding both parties' perspectives on Yocto to determine the direction for subsequent debugging work.

## Key Points from Communication with RK:
The ARED project is a first third-party Yocto system.
RK's SDK is another Yocto system, with significant differences:

* RK's Yocto includes complete firmware format, partition table, and boot process.
* ARED project is a complete x86 system, including a custom boot image with loader, grub, kernel, and partition table, along with third-party upgrade and recovery mechanisms packaged as wic firmware. There are significant differences compared to RK's Yocto.
* These differences impact the compilation, packaging, flashing, and booting of the entire system.

# Porting the system Methods:
## Method 1:
Port the necessary software packages from RK to the third-party rootfs. Then the compilation, packaging, flashing, and booting will be consistent with the customer's PCengine method.
Currently, we are not familiar enough with this method to proceed with debugging.
## Method 2:
Port the customer's third-party software packages to RK's rootfs. Then the compilation, packaging, flashing, and booting will follow RK's project process.
For this method, we need to know the specific software packages from ARED project that need to be ported. 
If we use this method, we can still seek help from RK if any issues arise.

# what we have been working on recently:
Configuring the environment and downloading poky, meta-openembedded, and meta-rockchip from GitHub as per the link: GitHub Link.
Successfully compiling and generating update.img, which can boot up.
The code structure and generated image screenshots are as follows:
